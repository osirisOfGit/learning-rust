# Checkers

## Goal

Get practice implementing [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) in combination with [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/), focusing on accomplishing intermediate concepts (due to my high-beginner experience in C++)

## Lessons Learned

- Don't rely on window scale factor to handle scaling - broke in Bevy 0.14 update. Scaling per entity is more reliable
and gives more control
