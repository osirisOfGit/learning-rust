# Checkers

## Goal

Get practice implementing [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) in combination with [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/), focusing on accomplishing intermediate concepts (due to my high-beginner experience in C++)

## Milestones

- [ ] Implement Traditional Checkers
  - [x] Drawing the board w/ proper colour scheme
  - [ ] Rendering the pieces in the correct positions w/ correct colours
  - [ ] Allow player to play both ends, enforcing turns
  - [ ] Win/lose conditions
  - [ ] Offer restart on loss
  - [ ] Restart button mid-game
  - [ ] Implement AI for one side, allowing player to pick their desired colour
- [ ] Enable/disable AI playing both sides via UI button, with speed modifier
- [ ] Implement a way to show what moves the AI is considering
- [ ] Allow adding additional, simultaneous games in the same window via a UI button.
  - Each game will be entirely independent of each other, allowing player to set AI and speed settings independently and play them at different speeds.
  - [ ] Resizing single board
  - [ ] Button to add new board, automatically resizing to fit appropriate amount
  - [ ] Button to remove existing board
